# 2048-AI

An attempt to implement a neat-like algorithm to solve the game 2048.

## What works

The game itself works perfectly, I was going to use an existing implementation, but I couldn't find one which allowed me to simply give inputs in the same manner that I've allowed myself here.

The human input script works perfectly too, in case you for some reason prefer playing with tiny ascii art.

The badai script is a very basic example of how you could write your own AI by hand, a FSM maybe.

The neural network script (nnai.py) works, letting you generate a random neural network, with layers to your specification etc..

## What doesn't

Evolving the neural network does not. While its possible I haven't given it enough time, I also haven't implemented any actual evolution of topology.
